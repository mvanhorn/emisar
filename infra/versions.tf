# emisar infrastructure — the full GCP deployment, prepared for SOC 2 Type II:
# a global HTTPS load balancer (Google-managed TLS) fronting a regional MIG of
# Container-Optimized OS instances running the portal image from public GHCR,
# backed by private-IP Cloud SQL Postgres, with Secret Manager, least-priv IAM,
# audit logging, monitoring, and the authoritative Cloud DNS zone (DNSSEC).
# Adapted from ../onlytty/infra. LIVE production infrastructure; the registrar
# DS is published and the DNSSEC chain validates publicly.

  # issued credentials and gates them behind workspace RBAC + audit logs. Treat
  # access to this workspace as access to production.
